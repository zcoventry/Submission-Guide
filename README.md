Welcome to the [U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (USLCI)][uslci_landing] Submission Handbook!  This handbook is intended to help those interested in publishing data in the USLCI answer two different types of questions:
  1. Should I publish my data in the USLCI?
  2. How do I publish my data in the USLCI?

This handbook is divided into three major sections.  [Section 1](../blob/master/Should-I-publish-in-the-USLCI) helps potential data submitters decide if publishing their data in the USLCI is a good fit for their publication goals.  [Section 2][section_2] contains a detailed guidance for publishing data in the USLCI.  [Section 3][section_3] provides answers to frequently asked questions.
