Welcome to the [U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (USLCI)][uslci_landing] Submission Guide!  This guide is composed of a [Submission Handbook](submission-handbook.md) and a [Resources file][link goes here].

The [Submission Handbook](submission-handbook.md) is intended to help potential data submitters find answers related to two questions:
  1. Should I publish my data in the USLCI?
  2. How do I publish my data in the USLCI?

The [Resources file][link goes here] contains resources which support the data submission process.

A detailed list of Submission Guide pages and resource is available [here]table-of-contents.md).
