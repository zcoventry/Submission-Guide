# How do I publish my data in the USLCI?

This page is part of the [USLCI Submission Guide].  The purpose of this page is to help you, the Data Provider, understand the entire process for publishing your life cycle inventory (LCI) data in the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (USLCI)][uslci-landing].  If you are looking for information to help you decide if publishing your data in the USLCI fits your publication goals, please see *[Should I publish in the USLCI?](should-i-publish-in-the-uslci.md)*.  You can also find a list of frequently asked questions [here](faq.md).

###### If you are ready to begin the publication process, [please use our online appraisal form](appraisal-form.md).

## Overview of the `Digital Curation Process`
NREL uses a `Digital Curation Process` for receiving, reviewing, publishing, and preserving data and metadata submitted to the USLCI.  The process is divided into five phases:
  1. [Appraisal](#appraisal)  
  2. [Ingest](#ingest)  
  3. [Review](#review)  
  4. [Publication](#publication)  
  5. [Preservation](#preservation)  

Phases 1-4 (i.e. Appraisal through Publication) take approximately 1-3 months to complete depending on the number and size of the datasets.  Each of the four phases is discussed in greater detail below.

### Appraisal
The Digital Curation Process begins with Appraisal.  This phase generally take 1-2 weeks to complete and it serves as a pre-screening to make sure that the scope of your data fits the USLCI's mission.

The Appraisal phase begins when you complete and submit the [online appraisal form](appraisal-form.md).  That information will be reviewed by a Data Curator who will reach out to you via phone or emial to set up an 30-60 minute Appraisal Meeting.  During the Appraisal Meeting you will discuss your publication goals with the Data Curator and you will receive feedback regarding whether the content and quality of your data fits with the USLCIs' mission.

The Appraisal Meeting will result in one of three outcomes:
  1. Acceptance
  2. Revise and Resubmit
  3. Denial

Data that is Accepted is moved to the [Ingest](#ingest) phase.  A *Revise and Resubmit* outcome means that 

During the Appraisal phase we review the information you provide in the [appraisal form]

## Working with NREL
The data publication process is a collaborative effort between you (i.e., the Data Provider) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  Practically speaking, that means you will be working closely with one of NREL's Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) Data Curators throughout the publication process.

The Data Curator's role is to guide you through the publication process.  This person is trained in LCI data curation and can help you troubleshoot technical issues related to the openLCA platform.

Your role in the publication process is transform your raw LCI data into a polished product that is ready for publication in the USLCI.  This means putting your data into the USLCI's [chosen data format](#data-publication-platform) and also pairing your data with robust metadata so that users of your data understand how to use it properly.  

The documentation and resources in the USLCI Submission Guide will be important resources in that process.

### How we communicate
We use [Slack][slack] as our primary written communication tool.  Slack allows the user great flexibility in communication because of its ability to push communication to/from email accounts, mobile devices, etc.   Furthermore, it provides context during communication through the ability to set up various channels based on conversation topic.  

Early in the publication process the Data Curator will work with you to get you set up on Slack.

### Our data publication platorm
NREL uses [openLCA v1.6][openlca_v16] as its platform for receiving, reviewing, and publishing LCI data.  [OpenLCA][openlca] is a free, opensource LCA software platform that is able to import data from many commercial LCA software applications including GaBi and SimaPro.

Early in the publication process the Data Curator will work with you to get you set up on Slack.
