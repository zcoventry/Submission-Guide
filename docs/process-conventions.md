The term, "Main Goal Situations", refers to an LCA study's primary intended purpose (European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 2010:3).| SITUATION A -- MICRO-LEVEL DECISION SUPPORT<br>*The intended application for this process is for micro-level decision support as described in goal situation A from the ILCD Handbook's Detailed Guidance (European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 2010:3).  LCA studies intended for micro-level decision support are often used to answer product-related questions.  Decisions stemming from these LCA studies "are assumed to have only limited or no structural consequences outside the decision-context, ...do not change available production capacity...[and do not cause] large-scale consequences in the background system or other parts of the technosphere[.]"*<br><br>SITUATION B -- MESO/MACRO-LEVEL DECISION SUPPORT<br>*The intended application for this process is for meso/macro-level decision support as described in Goal Situation B from the ILCD Handbook's Detailed Guidance (European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 2010:3).  LCA studies intended for meso/macro-level decision support are often used to support strategic level decisions such as "raw materials strategies, technology scenarios, policy options, etc.  [Such decisions] are assumed to [result in] large-scale consequences in the background system or other parts of the technosphere" (European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 2010:3).*<br><br>SITUATION C1 -- ACCOUNTING<br>*The intended application for this process is for accounting purposes as described in Goal Situation C1 from the ILCD Handbook's Detailed Guidance (European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 2010:3).  LCA studies intended for accounting purposes offer "purely descriptive documentation of the system under analysis (e.g. a product, sector or country), without being interested in any potential consequences on other parts of the economy," (European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 2010:3).  LCA studies categorized under Goal Situation C1 do consider existing benefits outside of the analyzed system such as recycling.*<br><br>SITUATION C2 -- ACCOUNTING<br>*The intended application for this process is for accounting purposes as described in Goal Situation C2 from the ILCD Handbook's Detailed Guidance (European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 2010:3).  LCA studies intended for accounting purposes offer "purely descriptive documentation of the system under analysis (e.g. a product, sector or country), without being interested in any potential consequences on other parts of the economy," (European Commission - Joint Research Centre - Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 2010:3).  LCA studies categorized under Goal Situation C2 do NOT consider existing benefits outside of the analyzed system such as recycling. |
