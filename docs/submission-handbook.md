Welcome to the [U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (USLCI)][uslci_landing] Submission Handbook!  This handbook is intended to help potential data submitters find answers related to two questions:
  1. Should I publish my data in the USLCI?
  2. How do I publish my data in the USLCI?

This handbook is divided into three major sections.  [Section 1](Should-I-publish-in-the-USLCI.md) helps potential data submitters decide if publishing their data in the USLCI is a good fit for their publication goals.  [Section 2][How do I publish my data in the USLCI.md] contains a detailed guidance for publishing data in the USLCI.  [Section 3][FAQ.md] provides answers to frequently asked questions.

A detailed table of contents for the Submission Guide is shown below.
